During a patientâ€™s stay in hospital a huge amount of data is routinely collected. Machine learning models may be able to interpret this data to predict how the rest of their stay will unfold, giving management decision makers useful insight into how resources should be allocated in order to improve patient outcomes. Recognising and analysing trends within this information can assist in long term planning to reduce the strain on healthcare systems.
This project investigates the applicability of machine learning techniques on real hospital data for provision of clinical predictions and decision support. A range of regression and classification algorithms are investigated and the models they produce are scrutinised to determine suitability for a hospital setting. In particular, this work demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble techniques to obtain high accuracies using weakly correlated variables. This work also emphasises the need for models to be explainable and understood by the user. Five target areas have been researched to develop models for: length of stay, diagnosis, medication, care unit transfers and medical procedures. 
The main finding was the ability to predict length of stay within the nearest week with 96.4% accuracy by considering eight categories of data. The results also show which of these tables are the best indicators for the other target variables, with some models outperforming the accuracy of unassisted doctors as discussed in literature.
